Updates for liz/nav_bar: 
I used Will's landing page code for a template. The navigation bar still needs to be made responsive, and I need to put the logo on the other side of the navigation bar (also: will the logo be the size marked in Zeplin? I resized the current logo based on the pixels in the wireframes, but I think it would need modification.)
Also, the navigation bar is not in _app.js.
