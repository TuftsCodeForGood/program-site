Updates for liz/nav_bar: 
I used Will's landing page code for a template. The navigation bar still needs to be made responsive, and I need to put the logo on the other side of the navigation bar (also: will the logo be the size marked in Zeplin? I resized the current logo based on the pixels in the wireframes, but I think it would need modification.)
Also, the navigation bar is not in _app.js.

# Tufts CS Code For Good Website

This website uses [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

## Setup
1. Ensure [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is installed. Then, run `nvm` use to use the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file.
2. Install depedencies: `npm install`
3. Run in development: `npm run dev`

The site should start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Deployment

Deployment is still TBD, but to build the site run `npm run build`. This will output the static site to the `out` directory.
